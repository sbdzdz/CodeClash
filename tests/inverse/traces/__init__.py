"""
Tests for traces/parsers/battlesnake.py - BattleSnakeTraceParser.

Tests:
1. Parse JSONL file correctly
2. Extract game metadata (id, ruleset, players)
3. Infer actions from position changes
4. Handle draw games
5. Handle games where players die
6. get_state_action_pairs() returns correct format
